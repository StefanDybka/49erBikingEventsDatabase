# 49erBikingEventsDatabase
Example database for the 49er Biking Events website.
Run these three sql scripts to create and populate the database tables for 49er Biking Events.

These specific table entries are not required for the program to run correctly, the application will run with empty tables of the same names.

A database user will be required for the webserver to access the database.
